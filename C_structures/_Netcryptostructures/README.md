## Description
An ecrypted artefactum data server that contains data and an artefactum data 
client to send and receive data from the server with restricted access. It 
works as a NonSQL data server based on data structures and artefactum datae or
data devices. It is specially  design for data warehouse with concurrent and 
distributed clients working as components of programs. It can also be installed
as a swarm of encrypted servers with an unique gateway for clients or multiple
gateways for regional segmentated clients.

Data structures includes tables, multimaps and graphs so SQL, NonSQL and Graph
Data Servers can be emulated. The server encrypt private keys and hash tables
to distributed public and private keys to the clients, so public keys may be 
share to operate transactions between clients and private keys to modified the
warehouse itself. It is non-repudiable: signed and certificated, zero knowledge 
and counteragressive based software.  Data is periodically backup and dynamically 
stored.
